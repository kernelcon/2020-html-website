Us either.</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Last year Kernelcon had 12 unique stickers that our most creative indivduals (and sometimes their family members) spent hours designing. Attendees received a handful of the same unique stickers so they could trade with others and collect the whole set.  It was one of our most talked about swag items, and a fun way to meet new people and get your sticker on.</p><p class="tab-sub-heading">This year, we would like our community to be a part of the sticker proess!</p><p class="tab-paragraph">So, even if you don't have a creative bone in your body, we would love to see your design! If your design is just an idea, we will try to help fledging artists achieve their <span class="text-highlight">vision</span>. Do you have an innovative artist in your family? We accept designs from attendee's family members too! It would be wonderful to include as many people as we can!</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Are you still interested?  If so, please send your sticker design to <a href="mailto:stickers@kernelcon.org" class="text-highlight" rel="noopener noreferrer">stickers@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will pick twelve awesome designs for this year's stickers and you will each get a shoutout and a paragraph in the conference book to describe your design.</p><p class="fine-notes">Note: Please keep your design to a high resolution (&gt; 300dpi) file.  Formats *.(png | pdf | ai | eps | psd) are all acceptable.</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Looking for inspiration? Look no further!

<div class="tab-title">Call for Training Courses</div><p class="tab-paragraph">The Kernelcon Trainings offer attendees technical courses on topics from the informattion security field. These will be hands-on courses that help expand attendees' skill sets and knowledge.</p><p class="tab-heading">Length and Cost</p><p class="tab-paragraph">The Kernelcon Crew is looking for training proposals that can fit into a full one-day or two-day format. Classes should typically follow a standard daily schedule, with short morning and afternoon breaks, and a one hour break for lunch.</p><p class="tab-paragraph">All one-day training courses will be offered to attendees at $500 all two-day courses will be offered at $1000.</p><p class="tab-heading">Proposal Due Date</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Training proposals are due no later than December 1st, 2019. Instructors will be notified of Acceptance/Rejections by the end of the day, December 31st, 2019.

Typically, this full one or two-day course will include significant hands-on experience. Classes can range from basic entry-level material to highly technical. We know that there is a wide variety of training readily available and Kernelcon prefers to provide highly interactive, immersive, and in general, any teaching technique that doesn't purely lecture. That said, mixing traditional lecture with hands-on components is something that can work well. Don't hesitate to submit your training summary and we can work with anyone.</p><p class="tab-heading">What are some preferred training workshop topics?</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Anything in the cybersecurity field that could benefit from hands-on experience. Specialized penetration and vulnerability testing, cybersecurity incident response simulation, cutting your teeth on reverse engineering with IDA Pro, and threat hunting 101, are all examples of plausible training. We are not looking for simple vendor pitches disguised as training and our attendees like classes where the student can take away enough from the training to return to home or work and immediately make use of their new skills.</p><p class="tab-heading">What do I need to have ready for the training workshop submission?</p><p class="tab-paragraph">The workshop does not need to be completely developed at the time of the submission. However, for evaluation, we do need to have very formal workflow and timing of the training you are proposing. (Detailed section below)</p><p class="tab-paragraph">You should have most of the material ready to go and have a rough idea of how it will be presented. We would also like to encourage multiple instructors <b>if</b> that is the best approach to cover the material.</p><p class="tab-heading">How do I structure a training submission?</p><p class="tab-paragraph">Training submissions should contain the following information.
